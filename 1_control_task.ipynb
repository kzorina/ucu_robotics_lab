The state $x=(q,v)$ is the concatenation of position and velocity of the copter, with $q=(x_1,x_2,\\theta)$, $x_1$ the horizontal position, $x_2$ the vertical position and $\\theta$ the angle) and  $v=(v_1,v_2,\\omega)$ the horizontal, vertical and angle velocities.\n",

Remember this is a local optimization solver, which you better warm start with a sound behavior when trying to achieve something fancy.\n",
